# Pharmacy Mobile Application 

## INTRODUCTION
The aim of this mobile application is basically an application for a delivery service where one can order a medicine and have it delivered at their house. Within Senegal I have yet to come across such an application, but I certainly am quite interested in seeing such an app here. The intended audience of such an application would certainly be elderly, ill, and people who have a hard time buying their own medicine physically. The features Iâ€™d want this app to have is where one can scroll and find the medicine they want to buy, give them purchasing options and an option to share their location for deliveries. Lastly, have the chance to see if certain medicines are still in stock or are sold out. 


## Description

The aim of this project is to create a mobile web app for phones, and possibly develop a mobile application for Android phones as well. The main feature of this mobile application is essentially to allow users to scroll, search, and make purchases. Other functionalities include enabling users to provide their location for deliveries. Additional features that could enhance the app's utility involve allowing users to upload their medical prescriptions and facilitating connections with their medical insurance providers. Through such integration, users may benefit from potential reductions in the prices of their purchases, thereby improving accessibility and affordability of healthcare products and services.
